# Supply Chain Optimisation and Performance Analysis 🚢📊

## Project Overview 🔍
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of supply chain operations, with the goal of identifying key performance drivers, inefficiencies, and opportunities for cost reduction and revenue growth. The project utilizes a dataset to answer critical business questions related to financial performance, operational efficiency, quality, risk, and customer insights. 🧠💰

## Project Components 📁
- **Supply Chain Optimisation and Performance Analysis.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and performance analysis. This is the core document of the project. 📓
- **supply_chain_data_cleaned.csv**: The cleaned and prepared dataset, ready for further analysis and visualization. 🗃️
- **SUPPLY CHAIN POWER BI DASHBOARD.pbix**: An interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a high-level overview of the supply chain's performance, allowing for dynamic filtering and deep dives into the data. 📊
- **SUPPLY CHAIN PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS.pptx**: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the key findings and insights from the analysis, designed for a client-facing audience. 📋

## Project Goal 🎯
To analyse a dataset of supply chain operations to identify key performance drivers, inefficiencies, and opportunities for cost reduction and revenue growth. 💰🚀

## Key Questions Addressed 🤔
This project aims to answer the following business questions:

### Financial Performance 💰
- What are the total revenue and costs, and how do they vary across different product types? 💸
- Which products have the highest and lowest profit margins? 📈📉
- How do shipping costs impact the overall profitability of different product types or routes? 🚚💲

### Operational Efficiency ⚙️
- What are the average lead times and shipping times? Are there any bottlenecks or inefficiencies? ⏱️🚢
- Which suppliers or shipping carriers are the most efficient in terms of lead time and cost? 🏭🚚
- How do stock levels and availability correlate with the number of products sold and revenue? 📦📈

### Quality and Risk 🔍🚨
- What is the overall defect rate, and are there specific products, suppliers, or manufacturing locations with higher defect rates? 🚫
- What is the rate of "Fail" vs. "Pass" inspection results, and what factors influence these outcomes? 🔍✅❌
- Are there any correlations between manufacturing costs, production volumes, and defect rates? 💰📉

### Customer and Market Insights 🧠🌍
- How do customer demographics relate to the types of products sold? 👥🛒
- Which products are most popular, and how can we use this information for future inventory planning? 📈📦
